// Load()/Save(); the Electron IPC + settings.json path live here and in main.

// Registered as a root service in app.mu's `.services:` block (bound to
// SettingsStoreKey). Load() is synchronous — the preload already snapshotted the
// file at startup — so ApplicationSettings has real persisted values the moment
// it is constructed; Save() write-throughs asynchronously.
