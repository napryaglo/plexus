// a file format, not a project. A module contributes a DocumentDefinition (mural)
// whose `Factory` service token resolves to an IDocumentFactory; the generic
// ProjectExplorerService resolves it by extension (DocumentTypeRegistry) and
// delegates open/save/new. Any project can open any file whose extension a
// registered editor handles — the editor opens it, regardless of project type.
//
// Persistence flows through the project's IStorage (rooted, project-relative
// paths); the factory never sees an absolute path or the raw file system.
