// The contract a module's project factory implements — the behavior the
// generic ProjectExplorerService delegates to. A module declares a
// ProjectFactoryDefinition (mural) whose Factory service token resolves to an
// IProjectFactory; the explorer routes create/open/save through it, staying
// ignorant of any concrete project. FILE editing (open/save/new a document)
// is a separate concern — an IDocumentFactory resolved by extension via the
// DocumentTypeRegistry; editors own files, factories own projects.
//
// Persistence flows through an IStorage (rooted at the project, project-relative
// paths) rather than the raw file system, so a project's backend — local FS
// today, cloud/REST later — is transparent to the factory. The explorer builds
// the IStorage and hands it in.

// The manifest file at a project folder's root. Its `type` routes a folder to
// the factory that owns it; the rest of the manifest is factory-specific (each
// factory reads/writes its own extended shape). Only this envelope is generic.
