// architecture-projects.module.mu - the Architecture Projects module.

// A ShellModule with NO nav Capability (like code-editor/problems/agent-chat):
// it carries only the BACKEND for architecture projects — the `architecture`
// project type (ArchitectureProjectFactory) — with no left-panel entry. Its
// `.todl` files are the architecture model; `.diagram` files inside are edited
// by the diagram module's generic DiagramDocumentFactory (resolved by extension),
// standalone today and model-bound once the ArchitectureModelService lands.
