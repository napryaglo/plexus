// its own inspector (bound to its own ActiveView), so switching diagrams swaps the
// docked inspector to the one that actually edits what's on screen. Without this
// the panel would stay bound to whatever document opened it first — editing a
// different diagram's shape would then apply to nothing.
//
// A behavior (MVVM's third leg): it reads VIEW state (the active Diagram's
// SelectionCount) — which a view-model may not — and translates it into a service
// write (PanelDockService.Add). It holds only view-transient lifecycle state (the
// per-document one-shot latch + listener handles); the inspectors and their
// selection tracking live on the DiagramDocuments.
//
// Wired from the bootstrap (main.js) with the document host. It watches the host's
// ActiveDocument, then that document's published ActiveView, so it needs no hook
// into the template-materialized tree: when a canvas mounts and publishes itself
// onto ActiveView, we attach the selection listener then.
