// Backs a single `.diagram` file through mural's DiagramStorage seam, so a
// DiagramDocument's native Save() / Load() persist the full scene (nodes,
// connectors, shape text) as JSON — no bespoke serializer needed.
//
// It writes through an IStorage at a project-relative Path, so the diagram's
// backend (local FS today, cloud/REST later) is transparent to the document.
//
// DiagramStorage is a synchronous key/value contract, but storage I/O is async,
// so this mirrors the settings-store pattern: reads are served from an
// in-memory snapshot (seeded from storage when the document is opened), and
// SetItem caches synchronously while firing the write in the background. Await
// WhenWritten() after Save() to be sure the bytes are persisted.
//
// A file holds exactly one diagram, so the storage KEY is ignored — there is a
// single slot. (mural writes/reads under one fixed internal key.)
