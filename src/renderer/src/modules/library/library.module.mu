// library.module.mu — the Library module.
//
// A ShellModule that contributes the "library" PROJECT TYPE (not a nav
// capability). A user creates a Library project from New Project against a chosen
// meta-model, authors technology-library (taxonomy) .todl definitions inside it
// (validated live by the shared base-aware TodlValidationService against the
// bound meta-model), and publishes the compiled model + sources into the
// libraries storage backend. A pure contributor — a service + a project factory,
// no Capability — so it declares no rail entry; the project type is reached via
// New Project.
//
// The `.todl` FILE editor is contributed by the meta-model module's `.documents:`
// entry (resolved by extension for any project), so this module only registers
// the project factory + its `.projectFactories:` routing.
