// plexus-icons.mu — the shared icon dictionary for Plexus.
//
// A standalone `resources` dictionary of vector icons: each `include` splices
// an SVG (under ./icons) into a keyed Geometry resource at compile time (via
// the CLI's SVG→geometry resolver). One geometry per capability shown in the
// shell's activity bar.
//
// Merged into the app's Resources by app.mu's `resources: { merge PlexusIcons }`
// directive, so every module's capabilities resolve `Icon = @<Key>` (a
// DynamicResource) against Application.Resources at render time. Painted by a
// Shape/Path with a theme brush — no colour is baked into the geometry.
